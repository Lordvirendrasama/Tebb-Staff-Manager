# **App Name**: TrackEat

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Simple authentication to differentiate users (Abbas and Musaib) with allowance.
- Allowance Tracking: Tracks remaining allowance (6 items) for each user, resetting monthly.
- Item Logging: Allows users to log consumed food/drink items (Coffee, Cooler, Milkshake, Maggie, Fries, Pasta), decreasing allowance.
- Allowance Limit Feedback: Notifies the user with “No free items left this month" message when the allowance limit is reached.
- Consumption History: Display the item name, date, and time of the last 5 logged items for each user.
- Admin Overview: An admin panel shows Abbas and Musaib’s remaining balances and provides access to the reporting feature.
- Report Tool: Allows the admin to generate a CSV/Excel file containing logs of consumed items by each user. Reasoning determines whether a particular entry is considered complete for export.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gray (#808080) to provide a clean and neutral interface. A slightly darker shade of gray (#A9A9A9) will be used for interactive elements and text to contrast against the background.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to offer a soft, non-distracting backdrop for the content.
- Accent color: A desaturated blue-gray (#607B8B) used to highlight important interactive elements like buttons, maintaining monochrome feel while adding subtle visual cues.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both headlines and body text due to its clean and modern appearance.
- Minimalist design with a focus on clear, simple content blocks and sufficient whitespace.
- Use simple, monochrome icons to represent food items, maintaining the overall monochrome theme.
- Subtle animations for transitions and user interactions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
